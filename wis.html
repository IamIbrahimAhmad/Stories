    <h1>What I See</h1>
    <p>
        In the heart of a city shrouded in gloom, where the sun dared not penetrate the thick veil of smog and the streets whispered tales of despair, lived a soul named Marcus. He was a man whose heart pulsed with goodness and empathy in a world stained by cruelty.
        <br><br> From his solitary apartment window, Marcus observed the bleak panorama below, witnessing the downtrodden masses trudging through their daily struggles, each burden etched deeply into their weary faces. Despite the darkness that engulfed
        the world, Marcus clung to the belief that his kindness could be a beacon of hope amidst the shadows.
        <br><br> But the world was relentless in its cruelty towards Marcus's benevolence. His acts of compassion were met with suspicion and scorn, as if his sincerity was a foreign language in a realm governed by deceit. People whispered behind his
        back, casting him as a fool or a weakling, unable to grasp the depth of his altruism.
        <br><br> Marcus's days stretched out in solitude, his only solace found in the pages of his books and the flickering glow of streetlights outside his window. He questioned why his gestures of kindness were viewed with such contempt, why the world
        seemed determined to extinguish the light he offered.
        <br><br> As he ventured into the world, Marcus couldn't help but notice the adulation showered upon those who embraced the darkness. The cunning, the ruthless, the ones who clawed their way to power by exploiting the vulnerabilities of others—they
        were hailed as heroes, their actions glorified and rewarded.
        <br><br> In the eyes of society, Marcus was an anomaly, a disruption to the established order. He watched as those who reveled in corruption were elevated to positions of influence, their misdeeds overlooked in the pursuit of power. Meanwhile,
        his own integrity was dismissed as weakness, overshadowed by the allure of dominance and control.
        <br><br> With each passing day, Marcus felt the weight of society's scorn pressing down upon him, his spirit growing heavy beneath the burden of rejection. Despite his best efforts, he found himself slipping into despair, the darkness that surrounded
        him seeping into his very soul.
        <br><br> And so, Marcus made a choice—a choice born of desperation and disillusionment. He turned away from the light that had once guided him, embracing the darkness that beckoned from the depths of his despair. In his quest for acceptance and
        validation, he cast aside his principles, embracing the same ruthlessness that he had once abhorred.
        <br><br> As the shadows closed in around him, Marcus became a different man—a man consumed by bitterness and resentment, his heart twisted by the cruelty of the world. And in his descent into darkness, he left behind the goodness that had once
        defined him, a mere echo of the soul he had once been.
